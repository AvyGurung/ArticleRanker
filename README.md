# ArticleRanker

This is a basic website that allows users to rank articles. There are 5 arrticles that the user has access to and must click the view button to read each one. The user has the option to hide the article once they are done reading it. The user also has access to rating each article as well as see the current rating of that article.

I was planning on optimising the code with for loops and recursive functions but did not have the time.

This Website was written in HTML and JavaScript.
It was developped using Visual Studio Code.
